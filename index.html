            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <P>My name is James Eckman. I am 40 years old, and up until recently, I thought I had life figured out. I was an expert in my field as an automotive technician, I was married, and owned a house. Then my world changed two years ago when my son, Logan, was born. My 60 hour work weeks, working weekends and every holiday, getting home after he was already asleep, and just not being fulfilled with or proud of my job was no longer going to cut it. That's why I have made the decision to change my career path to software development. I wanted a career where I am encouraged to be creative, make a positive contribution in the world, didn't get hurt on a daily basis, and (most of all) be more present in my son's life. I am very excited to embark on this journey and learn all I can about software development in effort to make great things along with other like-minded creative people.</P>
